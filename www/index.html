            In the year Ad Stella 101, researchers at the Vanadis Institute
            created "GUND", an advanced brain–computer interface that enabled
            the human nervous system to control artificial appendages and
            organs. The purpose of GUND was to enable humans to survive in the
            harsh environment of space. After receiving funding from mobile suit
            manufacturer Ochs Earth, the technology was developed into the "GUND
            Format" and employed for military uses, leading to the creation of
            "GUND-ARMS": mobile suits that use the GUND Format to increase the
            performance of their pilots. However, extensive use of GUND-ARMS
            resulted in pilots being crippled or even killed.[4][5] In response,
            the Mobile Suit Development Council, led by the top mobile suit
            development companies, ordered an entire permanent ban on the GUND
            Format and all its applications. Council member Delling Rembran,
            president of the Benerit Group, deployed the special forces team
            Dominicus to destroy the Vanadis research facility Fólkvangr,
            killing everyone aboard to erase all traces of the technology. Only
            two people survived: mobile suit test pilot Elnora Samaya and her
            four-year-old daughter Ericht Samaya. In the aftermath, those
            responsible for the development of the GUND Format were ostracized,
            and because the team was primarily composed of women, they became
            known as "witches".
